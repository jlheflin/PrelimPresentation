# Prelim Presentation Repo

Here in this repository is the culmination of everything I have done so far at Iowa State Unviersity.
This presentation serves to descibe the projects I have been involved in and what research I have
been working on. Research projects include:
- The NWChemEx Project
- Development of Preorganized Chelators for Rapid Separation of Nuclear Fission Products

This presentaiton will also describe a possible proposal for research. Who knows what that is.

The presentation is written in Typst, a typsetting language that requires the `typst` program to
compile the resultant code.
