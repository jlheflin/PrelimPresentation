\frametitle{Not Another QM Packge! Why!?}
Has you or a loved one tried to develop quantum chemistry models only to find that you need to know how to write Fortran, compile it against the original project, and ensure that it works in the end, only to have the entire
project not work after removing your new code and left at square 0 with no quantum chemistry package to use?

That's basically a story I have heard from every physical chemist that I have talked to. It is already hard to find and use the tools for computational chemistry. To develop new tools with zero computer science and programming background?
Nearly impossible (Ask me how I know).
